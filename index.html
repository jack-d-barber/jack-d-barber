                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>I'm a PhD student and Glasgow native currently based at the University of Aberdeen.</p>
                <p>While my background is in fundamental medical microbiology, over the past year I've come to a realisation; why can't I, as someone who has expertise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and is passionate about dismantling systemic inequalities, combine my unique experience, skillset and enthusiasm to answer the research questions that so often go unspoken? Answering the question of where my research interests lie has become a complicated question, but I'll give it a go. I want to use my quantitative background to ask questions such as:<br>
                <ul class="dashed-list">
                        <li>who is disproportionately at risk of AMR?</li>
                        <li>who faces a disproportionate burden of AMR?</li>
                        <li>what can we do to tackle the socioeconomic inequalities driving the above?</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>Global health has and continues to be a colonial project at its core, meaning disease is seen as something that is "in and of" the Global South. The classical outlook is one of saviourism at best, and at worst resorts to outright exploitation. But health inequalities are not unique to low- and middle-income countries - they exist here, in the UK and across the Global North, right on our doorstep. We still have much to understand about how inequality in high-income countries is driving the development of AMR - and how AMR is driving inequality in turn. Those who know about AMR will know why tackling said inequalities is critical: because with AMR, if one of us is left behind, we're all left behind.</p>

                <h2>MY WORK</h2>
                <p>RESEARCH</p>
                <p>In clinical settings, we see that when patients stop antibiotic treatment, the level of antibiotic resistance in the infecting bacterial population declines over time. We attribute this decline to antibiotic resistance coming with a "fitness cost" for bacteria, meaning that in the absence of antibiotics, they pay a cost to maintain resistance – so losing that antibiotic resistance from the bacterial population is beneficial. However, in the lab, we see that even in the absence of antibiotics populations of bacteria can maintain antibiotic resistance over long periods – perhaps indefinitely. My project focuses on identifying factors that could explain this disconnect, which may include the artificiality of lab experiments or the fact that antibiotic resistance may only be costly under specific conditions. We aim to reveal key missing pieces in our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning antibiotic resistance, and the results could both improve the validity of laboratory experiments and inform clinical practice. My project is supervised by Dr Tom Vogwill at the University of Aberdeen with funding from the BBSRC EASTBIO DTP.
                <p>DECOLONISING SBS</p>
                <p>In 2021, I was one of four founding members of Decolonising SBS, a grassroots PhD student-led activism group based in the University of Aberdeen's School of Biological Sciences. Working together with the shared goal of identifying and dismantling systemic racism within our department and across the wider university, we are self-organised and operate independently from departmental and university management.</p>
                <p>Although we are fundamentally limited in our power as PhD students, we've been able to forge partnerships across the university, including our valued relationships with the Students' Union and the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Students' Liberation Forum. Our focus is on creating social consciousness within our department, forming lasting knowledge-sharing partnerships and pushing for legislative changes at the senior management level. For example, I led in the formation of the Student Decolonising Network, an autonomous student-driven initiative connecting activists from across all Schools of the university. This network provides us student activists a space to form community, find new ways to push for decolonisation at the grassroots level and resist the university's attempts to depoliticise and deradicalise our work.</p>
